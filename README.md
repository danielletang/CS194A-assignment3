## Notes

The main challenges of this assignment were results of my inability to focus on it.
I think there's a lot more I could've done if I had spent a proper amount of time
working on the extensions and going to office hours. Unfortunately, I did not do
these things, so I didn't end up implementing a lot of extensions. I couldn't get
the search bar to work despite following the guide linked in the assignment. When I
debugged, it turned out that the search bar wasn't communicating to the activity, so
nothing showed up. I think with some Googling, I would have been able to fix this,
but I ultimately ran out of time. This is an assignment I'd like to continue adding
to even after the deadline because I think I can do more with it!
